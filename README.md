# Git Beyond Basics â€” My Git Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Git Beyond Basics** project â€” a practical website I built to master Git **step by step** while learning real-world workflows used in top tech companies.

##  About This Project

This is not just a simple HTML-CSS-JS site â€” itâ€™s a **hands-on Git learning lab**.  
Here, I explore everything from **basic commits** to **advanced branching, merging, rebasing, and conflict resolution** â€” all documented through code and branches.

Each branch represents a **new Git concept or experiment** â€” making this repo a visual record of my journey from beginner â†’ intermediate â†’ advanced Git user.
