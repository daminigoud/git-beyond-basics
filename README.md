# 🚀 Git Beyond Basics — My Git Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Git Beyond Basics** project — a practical website I built to master Git **step by step** while learning real-world workflows used in top tech companies.

## 🧠 About This Project

This is not just a simple HTML-CSS-JS site — it’s a **hands-on Git learning lab**.  
Here, I explore everything from **basic commits** to **advanced branching, merging, rebasing, and conflict resolution** — all documented through code and branches.

Each branch represents a **new Git concept or experiment** — making this repo a visual record of my journey from beginner → intermediate → advanced Git user.
